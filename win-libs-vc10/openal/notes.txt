This is OpenAL Soft 1.16.0, downloaded from:
http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal-releases/openal-soft-1.16.0.tar.bz2

Compiled with CMake 3.2.1 with MSVC 2010 and the Windows 7 SDK.

CMake was unable to locate dsound.lib, I had to manually point it at its location
in my copy of the Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010).

Disabled SSE 4.1 support in the 64-bit build, all SSE support for the 32-bit one.

Note that the library is called OpenAL32.dll even on 64-bit Windows.

License is LGPL, see COPYING file.
