This is libjpeg-turbo 1.3.0, downloaded from:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/libjpeg-turbo/files/1.3.0/libjpeg-turbo-1.3.0.tar.gz

Compiled in Release mode using CMake 2.8.11.2 and Visual Studio 2010 on Windows 7.
Disabled SIMD extensions by unticking WITH_SIMD in the CMake configuration.
The reason why I'm not just getting the SIMD-enabled version from the download page
is that not all 32-bit processors are guaranteed to support it, unlike with x86-64.
