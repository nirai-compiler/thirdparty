This is libsquish 1.11, downloaded from:
http://libsquish.googlecode.com/files/squish-1.11.zip
Compiled in Release mode using the supplied vs9 solution on Windows 7.
I imported the vs9 solution into Visual Studio 2010 Express.

I disabled "Whole Program Optimization" under C/C++ -> Optimization.

For the record, libsquish 1.11 is functionally identical to 1.10, the
difference being that 1.11 includes Visual Studio solution files.

Addendum: I've also compiled the project in debug mode and added
squishd.lib to the lib directory.
